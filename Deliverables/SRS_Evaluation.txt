CMSI 4072 project ~ Spring 2024
George Harrison
WaveX project
==============================

Software Requirements Specification Document:
---------------------------------------------
-- Introduction Section
   It would be helpful to have some sort of introduction to the document, to
   make sure that the reader knows some context for the user stories.  It
   doesn't have to be extensive, just a very high-level overview.

-- Functional Requirements
   These are very good and your acceptance criteria seem very complete!

-- Performance Requirements
   I like the way you worked the performance requirements into the epics and
   child stories ~ you almost snuck that by me, George!

-- Environment Requirements
   This would be a very useful section to fill in, even if it's not in the
   Agile format, just so that people will know what is needed to develop and
   to deploy the application.  Even if it is designed to operate in a web
   browser, it's helpful to know that fact.

=============================================================================
your score:  9% out of 10% which is an A-minus

All in all, a GREAT first effort, you just need to fill in more specifics.

Make the changes as suggested above, including many more requirements for
the second submission and you'll get the full 10% on this document.
