-- General Comments
   Good work here, George!

-- Introduction Section
   Perfect ~ no further comments, nothing to add for the second submission.

-- Project Resources Section
   Perfect ~ no further comments, nothing to add for the second submission.

-- Project Organization Section
   This section is where you would want to describe what I've commented on
   below.  Are you developing sections in parallel?  If so, how is that done
   with only one person?

-- Project Schedule Section
   Your Gantt chart looks really good, but I'm wondering how, with only one
   person as a resource, you get the overlap of the activities?  That seems
   a bit inconsistent...

=============================================================================
your score:  9.5% out of 10% which is an A

Make the changes as suggested above for the second submission and you'll get
the full 10% on this document.
