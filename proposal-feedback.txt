CMSI 4072 project ~ Spring 2024
George Harrison
WaveX project
==============================

Proposal Document:
------------------
   Nice work on the document.  The description is at high enough level to
   give the reader an overview, and yet low enough level to let the reader
   know your project can do.  This section is very complete!

   The justification section is also well done.  I like that you have some
   self-reflection in there, how you will improve your C++ skills to a new
   context, so you'll be challenging yourself.  Good!  DSP is not only a
   useful technology in music, but also finds extensive use in all forms of
   communications from satellites to cell phones...

Proposal Presentation:
----------------------
   Good job on the presentation!  Although the slide information is minimal,
   all the required 'stuff' is there.  You really seem to know your subject
   and that came across during the presentation.  With only one technology
   you could have elaborated a bit more in the slides ~ what does 'Juice'
   offer for your project, and what parts of it will you leverage to make it
   a unique product?


=============================================================================
your score:  5% out of 5% which is an A-plus

Great job on this presentation and proposal and great start to the semester!
