============================================================================

Your score: 48 out of 50 = 96% which is an A

Comments/feedback:

problem 7-5: Actually the error handler should be in the CALLER, not in the
   CALLED function.  The called function might throw the exception, but it's
   the job of the caller to handle that exception.

problem 8-11: You have three pairs of people finding bugs, so you need to do
   three calculations and average the results.  That should give you 14 bugs.

Good job!!

It has been a great pleasure to have you folks in my classes over the years,
and I look forward to hearing from you as you make your marks upon the world
and the industry.  Keep up the good work!
