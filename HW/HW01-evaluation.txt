problem 4.2 the critical path is G -> D -> E -> M -> Q totaling 32 days.  it
   could also be H -> I -> D -> E -> M -> Q which is still 32 days.  The way
   to do this is look at all the starting tasks, A, C, F, G, and H.  F has
   no successors.  G has the longest duration.  Then trace what comes after
   G which is L, D, and O.  Find the longest of those and keep doing that
   same thing, adding up the duration each time.  If you find a path that is
   longer, use that path instead.  Keep going until you get to the end.

problem 4.4 you are starting your schedule on Monday when the problem states
   that January 1 is a WEDNESDAY.  You also are not allowing for specified
   holidays so your developers will not be happy.  Further, your schedule is
   linear in nature ~ you're not taking advantage of the overlapping tasks,
   so your schedule is way late.  It should end on February 18th.

problem 5.3 although a good case could be made for your selections, actually
   the options should be categorized as:
      User: b, c, d, l, m, n, o, p
      Business: a
      Functional: b, c, d, j, k, l, m, n, o, p
      Non-functional: e, f, g, h, i
      Implementation: empty

problem 5.9 you don't have any "won't" requirements listed.  Even if you are
   not planning to implement them, they should still be listed for future
   reference.  They may later become stretch goals or might be moved up into
   a different category.

Good job on this assignment, George!  Keep up the good work.
