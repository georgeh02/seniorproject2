Comments:
---------
Nice work on this assignment.

On 5.2, good thinking outside the box on suggesting component-based as an
alternative solution.

On 5.8, the diagram is very nice!  I notice that there is no way to begin a
number with a digit, since there is not a path to get to the first state
unless it is through a sign.  Also missing is the optional sign for the
exponent, which should come after the E/e entry.

Nice work on the inheritance diagram.

Very good job overall, George ~ keep up the good work!!
